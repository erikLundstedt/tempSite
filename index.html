					the next step is as easy as dragging and dropping the .zip file to the <b>multiMC</b> window.<br>
					shown in the image is the edit window.<br>
					here you can change the name ,group and icon of the pack.<br>
					you also get here if you press the "add instance" button in the <b>multiMC</b> UI.<br>
					when you are happy with the name and icon you can press OK.<br>

					you might not see the cute cat when you first install it,<br>
					to get the cute cat to show up <br>

					all of my packs uses the java path found in a linux based OS.<br>
					this means that you will have to go to the settings section under "edit instance".<br>
					now check the "java installation" box and click auto detect.<br>
					one of the alternatives should have a yellow star beside it <br>
					this is the one you should probably chose.

					if your game crashes it MIGHT be because<br> you havent given java enough memory <br>
